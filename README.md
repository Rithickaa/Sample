This Python code generates a creative short story based on a sequence of emojis using the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. It first installs the required library and imports the necessary modules. The GPT-2 model is loaded using the pipeline function for text generation. A seed is set for reproducibility so the output remains consistent.

A function named emoji_to_story is defined, which takes emoji input and prepares a prompt that asks GPT-2 to generate a fun and imaginative story starting with "Once upon a time". The generator function uses sampling parameters like temperature, top-k, and top-p to make the story diverse and creative. It also ensures that the generated text is not too long and ends properly using the EOS token.

After generating the story, the prompt part is removed to show only the story content. The code then sets a specific emoji input, calls the function, and prints both the emoji input and the generated story output in a readable format.
