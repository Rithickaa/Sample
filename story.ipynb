I didn't know much about math or science until I started reading comics. As a kid, I always wanted to be a math teacher, but I had no idea how to teach this kind of subject. After reading a few books, I discovered that books and comics could both be useful in learning and to socialize with. I started working on the story concept of Misha, and I wanted to start my own comic book series. It was a good idea, and I started looking into it.
